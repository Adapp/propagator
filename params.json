{"name":"Propagator","tagline":"Centralized schema & data deployment on a multi-everything topology","body":"## Outbrain Propagator\r\n\r\n**Propagator** is a schema & data deployment tool that works on a multi-everything topology: \r\n\r\n  * Multi-server: push your schema & data changes to multiple instances in parallel\r\n  * Multi-role: different servers have different schemas\r\n  * Multi-environment: recognizes the differences between development, QA, build & production servers\r\n  * Multi-technology: supports MySQL, Hive (Cassandra on the TODO list)\r\n  * Multi-user: allows users authenticated and audited access\r\n  * Multi-planetary: TODO\r\n\r\nIt makes for a centralized deployment control, allowing for tracking, auditing\r\nand management of deployed scripts.\r\n\r\nIt answers such questions as \"Who added column 'x' to table 't' and when?\",\r\n\"Was that column added to the build & test servers?\"; \"It's not there; was\r\nthere a failure? What was the failure?\". It provides with: \"OK, let's deploy\r\nit on all machines\"; \"There was some error and it's fixed now. Let's deploy\r\nagain on this paritular instance\"; \"We already deployed this manually; so\r\nlet's just mark it as 'deployed'\".\r\n\r\n_Propagator_ is developed at [Outbrain](http://www.outbrain.com) to answer for\r\nthe difficulty in managing schema changes made by dozens of developers on a\r\nmulti-everything topology in continuous delivery.\r\n\r\n_Propagator_ is released as open source under the [Apache 2.0\r\nlicense](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
