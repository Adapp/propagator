	<h6>About Propagator</h6>
	<p>
		<strong>Propagator</strong> is a schema & data deployment tool that works on a multi-everything topology:
		<ul>
			<li>Multi-server: push your schema & data changes to multiple instances in parallel</li>
			<li>Multi-role: different servers have different schemas</li>
			<li>Multi-environment: recognizes the differences between development, QA, build & production servers</li>
			<li>Multi-technology: supports MySQL, Hive (Cassandra on the TODO list)</li>
            <li>Multi-user: allows users authenticated and audited access</li>
			<li>Multi-planetary: TODO</li>
		</ul>
		It makes for a centralized deployment control, allowing for tracking, auditing and management of deployed scripts.
