###### About Propagator

**Propagator** is a schema & data deployment tool that works on a multi-everything topology: 

  * Multi-server: push your schema & data changes to multiple instances in parallel
  * Multi-role: different servers have different schemas
  * Multi-environment: recognizes the differences between development, QA, build & production servers
  * Multi-technology: supports MySQL, Hive (Cassandra on the TODO list)
  * Multi-user: allows users authenticated and audited access
  * Multi-planetary: TODO
It makes for a centralized deployment control, allowing for tracking, auditing
and management of deployed scripts.

_Propagator_ is developed at [Outbrain](http://www.outbrain.com) to answer for
the difficulty in managing schema changes made by dozens of developers on a
multi-everything topology in continuous delivery.
