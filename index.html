<p><strong>Propagator</strong> is a schema &amp; data deployment tool that works on a multi-everything topology: </p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-server: push your schema &amp; data changes to multiple instances in parallel</li>
<li>Multi-role: different servers have different schemas</li>
<li>Multi-environment: recognizes the differences between development, QA, build &amp; production servers</li>
<li>Multi-technology: supports MySQL, Hive (Cassandra on the TODO list)</li>
<li>Multi-user: allows users authenticated and audited access</li>
<li>Multi-planetary: TODO</li>
</ul><p>It makes for a centralized deployment control, allowing for tracking, auditing
and management of deployed scripts.</p>

<p>It answers such questions as "Who added column 'x' to table 't' and when?",
"Was that column added to the build &amp; test servers?"; "It's not there; was
there a failure? What was the failure?". It provides with: "OK, let's deploy
it on all machines"; "There was some error and it's fixed now. Let's deploy
again on this paritular instance"; "We already deployed this manually; so
let's just mark it as 'deployed'".</p>

<p><em>Propagator</em> is developed at <a href="http://www.outbrain.com">Outbrain</a> to answer for
the difficulty in managing schema changes made by dozens of developers on a
multi-everything topology in continuous delivery.</p>
